## Welcome!
Welcome to the Deepest git page! We will provide descriptions of us and our page here.  

## About Deepest 
We are enthusiasts of **deep learning** from Seoul, Korea.  
**Deepest** consists of researchers and engineers with a wide rage of interests and backgrounds from both field and school. 

## About our Git page 
We created this page for project management and sharing. We hope this page can be a hub for long-term knowledge and techniques of Deepest.

Our repositories are categorized primarily by the following criteria:  
```
Vision  
Audio/Speech Processing  
Natural Language Processing  
Reinforcement Learning  
General  
Reading Group
```

These categories can also be found in the **Teams** tab. However, please note that this tab is only visible to Deepest community members.

## About our main teams    
Our main teams (e.g. Vision, NLP, Reading Group ...) can be classified broadly according to their task type, which are either project implementation or paper review. ([link](https://github.com/orgs/Deepest-Project/teams))

### 1) Project implementation teams  
Ongoing and finished projects are listed at each of the main team's page. ([example](https://github.com/orgs/Deepest-Project/teams/vision))

To begin working on a project, the proposer of that project should consider and carry out the following:
1) The project leader **Pin and announce** the project at the corresponding main team's discussion page.
2) Create your project team page within the main team. ([example](https://github.com/orgs/Deepest-Project/teams/image2caricature))

Team members can **discuss and share** their project and **track** their progress at the project team page. Likewise, please note that all of these are only visible to Deepest community members. 

Once the project team repository is created, please add it to the project team page. (**Only for public repo.**)

#### How to add repositories  
1. **Fork or build** the repository in the **oraganization main page**.  
2. **Add** the repository to the the **project team page**.

### 2) Reading Group  
Members can open reading groups at the Reading Group team main page. ([example](https://github.com/orgs/Deepest-Project/teams/reading-groups))

Once a reading group is fixed, the proposer of that reading group should consider and carry out the following:
1) The reading group leader **Pin and announce** an overview of your reading group (when, where, what, etc) at the main team's discussion page.  
2) Create your reading group team page and a repository containing a wiki page within the main team. ([example](https://github.com/orgs/Deepest-Project/teams/neurips-2018))  

You can announce detailed schedules (when, where, detailed what, who) periodically at the reading group team page.
